# RStudio Marketing Content Showcase

Welcome to the Marketing Content Showcase repository. You can see our gallery on RStudio's Connect server, [colorado.rstudio.com](https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/rstudio-marketing-content-showcase/).

We walked through how to create this document using R Markdown and [connectwidgets](https://rstudio.github.io/connectwidgets/) in our blog post, [Curating Your Data Science Content on RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/rstudio-connect-data-showcase/).
